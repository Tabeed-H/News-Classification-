REAL SAMPLE:
From today onwards, Malaysia will no longer punish those who try to commit suicide with jail or fine, as it is no longer a crime in the country.
Instead, the Malaysian government has improved its mental health law, by empowering more officers to rescue those who attempt suicide and quickly get medical help for them.
In a joint statement by the Prime Minister’s Department’s Legal Affairs Division (BHEUU) and the Health Ministry (MOH), the government said it had today enforced three new laws in conjunction with World Suicide Prevention Day 2025. These three laws were passed in Parliament in 2023, but did not take effect until today.
“It is the Madani government’s hope that the reforms of these laws will be a huge shift in efforts to prevent attempted suicides in Malaysia, by encouraging those whose mental health are affected, to step forward to get help; to eradicate stigma towards attempted suicides and reduce the rate of deaths due to suicides,” BHEUU and MOH said in the statement.

FAKE SAMPLE:
In an unprecedented development, leaked documents allegedly reveal that leaders from the United States, China, Russia, and the European Union met on a remote island last month to finalize plans for a single global currency. The currency, code-named "OneCoin", is said to replace all national currencies by 2026.According to unnamed insiders, the agreement includes eliminating physical cash, forcing all citizens to use digital wallets monitored by international agencies. Critics argue that this is a step toward complete government surveillance and loss of individual freedoms. Social media posts claiming to expose the details of the meeting were reportedly deleted within hours, fueling speculation of a cover-up.
Opponents fear that "OneCoin" will give global elites unprecedented control over personal spending and could be switched off for anyone who opposes government policies. Despite official denials, rumors about the secret summit continue to spread rapidly online.
